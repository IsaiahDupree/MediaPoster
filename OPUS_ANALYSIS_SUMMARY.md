## 💡 Unique Value Propositions

   - Us: Topics, hooks, tone, pacing, visual analysis

2. **Pre-Production Intelligence**
   - Opus: Works after filming
   - Us: Analyze past content to improve future content

3. **Social Performance Tracking**
   - Opus: Clip analytics only
   - Us: Track 18 accounts across 8 platforms with live data

4. **Visual Intelligence**

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Opus adds deep content analysis
**Likelihood:** Low (not their focus, would slow down their speed advantage)  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Build deep moat in intelligence, move fast, establish brand

### Risk 2: Market prefers speed over quality
**Likelihood:** Medium (many creators prioritize quantity)  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Target quality-focused segment, prove ROI of better content

### Risk 3: Can't compete without posting
**Likelihood:** Medium (posting is table stakes)  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Add basic posting in Phase 2, but lead with intelligence

---

## 🤝 Partnership Opportunity

### Scenario: Pre-Production Intelligence for Opus Users

**Workflow:**
1. Use MediaPoster to analyze past content
2. Get insights on what works
3. Create new content based on insights
4. Use Opus to clip and distribute
